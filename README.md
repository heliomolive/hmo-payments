# Spring Boot State Machine example project

This example project uses Spring State Machine to construct an application that processes credit card operations (authorization, pre-authorization).

Sorry for not including tests. I developed this project while I was studying how to use state machines, some strategies changed during the project execution. So it was easier to me testing by running the application than creating unit tests.
